I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer formally trained as a quantitative political scientist. I work at [Devoted Health](http://www.devoted.com/), using data science and machine learning to help fix America's health care system. Previously, I was Chief Data Scientist at the Kenyan startup [BRCK](https://www.brck.com/), founded the AI company [New Knowledge](http://www.newknowledge.io), cohosted the data science podcast [Partially Derivative](http://www.partiallyderivative.com), led the humanitarian non-profit [Ushahidi's](http://www.ushahidi.com) work on crisis data, and was the director of the low-resource technology governance project at [FrontlineSMS](http://www.frontlinesms.com).

I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Davis researching the quantitative impact of civil wars on health care systems. I earned a B.A. from the University of Miami, where I triple majored in political science, international studies, and religious studies.
